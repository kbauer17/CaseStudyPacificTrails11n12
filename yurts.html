          <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
          <section>
          <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
          <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
              Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome
              that can be opened.</p></section>

          <section>
          <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
          <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.  Your
              luxury camping experience included electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.  Shower
              and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p></section>

          <section>
          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with
              light layers of clothing.  It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p></section>
